How to write queries:
>> https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/

Examples:
All topics, all partitions, all offsets
>> kafka_topic_partition_current_offset

Same as the one above but for specific topic
>> kafka_topic_partition_current_offset{topic="auction-bid-topic"}

How the offset changed the last minute (each 5s probe due to such configuration)
>> kafka_topic_partition_current_offset{topic="auction-bid-topic"}[1m]

How many items we have in all partitions for the selected topic
>> sum(kafka_topic_partition_current_offset{topic="auction-bid-topic"} )

performance/throughput of each partition of the cluster for 1m for specific topic
>> rate(kafka_topic_partition_current_offset{topic="auction-bid-topic"} [1m])

performance/throughput of each partition of the cluster for 1m for specific topic, but 10m ago
>> rate(kafka_topic_partition_current_offset{topic="auction-bid-topic"} [1m] offset 10m)

>> performance/throughput of the cluster for 1m for specific topic (sum of individual partitions)
sum(rate(kafka_topic_partition_current_offset{topic="auction-bid-topic"} [1m]))
